# Employee Directory

## Description 
  For this project, we needed to create a working Employee Directory using React JS. The project required to be broken up into components, using component state and responding to user events. They should be able to sort by table headers and filter by employee name. I also included Material UI for the styling.

  ```
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
